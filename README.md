# Machine-Learning-Projects
This project showcases end-to-end machine learning workflow using synthetic data: data generation, train-test splitting, training multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), evaluating with ROC/AUC, and visualizing resultsâ€”demonstrating model comparison, performance analysis, and binary classification insights.
